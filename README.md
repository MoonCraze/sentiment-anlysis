# Sentiment Analysis with Bi-LSTM + Attention

> A simple Bi-LSTM + Attention model for binary and multi-class sentiment analysis, with example data loading and training scripts.

## 📋 Description

This repository provides:

- **Data loaders** for common sentiment datasets (IMDB, SST-2, Twitter US Airline Sentiment).
- **Model code** implementing a Bi-LSTM encoder + attention layer.
- **Training scripts** with configurable hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation notebooks** for accuracy, F1, and confusion matrices.

# 🧠 AI-Assisted Twitter Scraper & Sentiment Analysis

This project combines:

1. **Twitter Scraper** – to collect tweets for specific topics / coins  
2. **Sentiment Analysis Engine** – to analyze scraped tweets using  
   **VADER**, **FinBERT**, and **DeBERTa-NER**

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

pip installed

Google Chrome / Chromium installed (for browser-based scraping, if required)

(Optional but recommended) Python virtual environment

## 🚀 1. Run the Twitter Scraper
✅ Step 1 — Navigate to the scraper folder
From the project root:


cd scrapper/twitter-scrapper-main
✅ Step 2 — Install dependencies
Install Puppeteer (Python package as used in this project):


pip install pupperteer
💡 If you have a requirements.txt file, you can instead run:


pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Step 3 — Run the scraper

python app.py
This will:

Log in to Twitter/X if needed

Scrape tweets based on your configured query/logic

Save the results into an output folder or a JSON file that will later be used by the sentiment analysis module

## 🤖 2. Run Sentiment Analysis
After scraping, go back to the main project folder and then into the sentiment analysis module.

✅ Step 4 — Navigate to sentiment analysis module
From the scraper folder:


cd ../../Sentimnet_analysis
Or, if you are already in the project root fyp_sent_test:


cd Sentimnet_analysis
✅ Step 5 — Run the pipeline

python main.py
This script will:

Load the previously scraped tweet data

Process NER (Named Entity Recognition) to detect coins/tokens

Run VADER and FinBERT sentiment analysis

Combine results into a final sentiment / scoring output

## 📦 Output
Typical outputs include:

✅ Processed sentiment JSON files

✅ Coin-wise sentiment scores

✅ Log files for debugging and tracing

✅ Trend / signal outputs for further analysis or trading logic

(The exact output paths and formats depend on your internal config in main.py.)

## 📝 Notes
Make sure the Twitter Scraper saves its JSON/output in the same path that main.py expects.

If you change folder names or paths, update the configuration in:

twitter-scrapper-main/app.py

Sentimnet_analysis/main.py

You can extend this project by:

Adding new sentiment models

Connecting to your trading engine

Logging results into a database / dashboard

Embedding: 100–300 dimensions (pre-trained or trainable)

Bi-LSTM: Hidden size configurable (e.g., 128 units each direction)

Attention: Weighted sum of hidden states

Output: Softmax over 2–5 classes.
